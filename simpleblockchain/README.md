## simpleblockchain
This is a personal project to learn the simple concepts of blockchain and how consensus is working this project is based on an old project from https://www.pyscoop.com/, after fixed couple of errors, and added some new variables to understand better the concepts, still few errors to fix. We added a postman collection so we can test better the code.

### How to use the code
1. run python3.6 web_app.py
2. run python3.6 web_app.py -p 64038
3. run postman and import the postman collection called blockchain.postman_collection.json. 
4. start with a couple of tests from postman.
